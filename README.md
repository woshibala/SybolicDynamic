# Modified Hopcroft algorithm
> We know that every sofic shift has a right-resolving presentation. In order to learn from sofic shift, it’s necessary to have a minimal presentation for every sofic shift. Because sofic shifts are analogous to DFA, it’s intuitive for us to looking for existed algorithms in the automata theory. DFA minimization is such a task that transforming a given deterministic finite automaton (DFA) into an equivalent DFA that a mini- mum number of states [4]. One algorithm for DFA minimization is Hopcroft’s algorithm, which is based on partition refinement, partitioning the DFA states into groups by their behavior.<br/>
